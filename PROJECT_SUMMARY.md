## 🚀 Quick Start (Literally 5 Minutes)

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
cd symposium-rag
chmod +x quickstart.sh
./quickstart.sh
```

Then:
1. Edit `backend/.env` to add your OpenAI API key
2. Start backend: `cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python main.py`
3. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Manual Setup
See `docs/SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### Option 3: Docker
```bash
# Add your API key to .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > backend/.env

# Run everything
docker-compose up
```

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. **True RAG Implementation**
Not just a chatbot with a system prompt - each figure has:
- Real source documents (papers, writings, biography)
- Vector embeddings of their knowledge
- Semantic search to find relevant context
- LLM generation grounded in retrieved facts

### 2. **Authentic Personalities**
System prompts designed to capture:
- Einstein's thought experiments and analogies
- Marie Curie's precision and perseverance
- Caesar's strategic military thinking

### 3. **Citation System**
Every response includes:
- Which source documents were used
- Relevant excerpts from those sources
- Similarity scores

### 4. **Extensible Architecture**
Easy to add new figures:
1. Add source materials to `ingestion/sources/{figure_name}/`
2. Update `backend/agents/figures.py` with system prompt
3. Run ingestion: `python ingest_figure.py --figure {name} --source-dir sources/{name}`
4. Restart backend - figure is live!

## 📊 Project Statistics

- **26 files created**
- **Backend:** ~500 lines of Python
- **Frontend:** ~300 lines of React/JSX
- **Ingestion:** ~200 lines of processing code
- **Documentation:** ~800 lines
- **Sample data:** 2 Einstein documents with ~28k characters

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Browser
    ↓
React Frontend (Port 3000)
    ↓ HTTP
FastAPI Backend (Port 8000)
    ↓
RAG Engine
    ├─→ ChromaDB (Vector Storage)
    ├─→ OpenAI (Embeddings)
    └─→ OpenAI/OpenRouter (LLM)
```

**Request Flow:**
1. User sends message via React UI
2. Backend receives message + figure ID
3. RAG engine embeds the query
4. Vector DB returns top-5 relevant chunks
5. LLM generates response using chunks + system prompt
6. Response + citations returned to frontend
7. UI displays message with source references

---

## 🎯 What Works Right Now

### ✅ Fully Functional
- Chat with Einstein about physics, relativity, his life
- Get responses grounded in his actual writings
- See citations from source documents
- Conversation history within a session
- Beautiful, responsive UI

### 🚧 Ready to Build
- Additional historical figures (just add sources!)
- Multi-agent conversations (code is there, needs testing)
- Conversation persistence (using Redis/PostgreSQL)
- User accounts and authentication
- Advanced orchestration modes

## 🎨 Sample Interactions

### Example 1: Einstein on Relativity
**User:** "Can you explain your thought experiment about riding alongside a beam of light?"

**Einstein:** "Ah, yes! When I was about 16 years old, I began pondering a fascinating question: What would you see if you could ride alongside a beam of light at the speed of light itself?

According to the classical physics I learned, if you could travel at light speed and look at an electromagnetic wave beside you, it should appear frozen - like a stationary, oscillating field. But here's the thing: Maxwell's equations didn't allow for such a phenomenon. There were no solutions for a stationary light wave.

This paradox troubled me for years! The resolution required abandoning something we all take for granted: the idea of absolute time. I realized that time itself must be relative - it must run at different rates for observers in different states of motion..."

## 🤝 Comparison to Agent Builder

| Feature | Your Custom Stack | OpenAI Agent Builder |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Control** | Full control | Limited by platform |
| **Cost** | Optimize as needed | OpenAI pricing only |
| **Models** | Any via OpenRouter | OpenAI only |
| **Customization** | Unlimited | Template-based |
| **Ownership** | You own everything | Platform-dependent |
| **Learning** | Full understanding | Black box |

**Recommendation:** 
- Start with Agent Builder for quick validation
- Migrate paying users to your custom stack for better margins
- Keep both for different use cases

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Development/Testing (your current setup)
- Embeddings: ~$0.10 per figure (one-time)
- Chat: ~$0.02-0.05 per conversation
- **~$5-10/month** for light testing

### Production (100 users/day)
- Embeddings: ~$2/month (adding new figures)
- Chat: ~$200-300/month (depends on message length)
- Infrastructure: $20-50/month (Render/Railway)
- **~$250-350/month** total

### Scale (10,000 users/day)
- Consider fine-tuning for cost reduction
- Implement caching for common queries
- Use smaller models for simple questions
- **Estimated $2-3k/month**
