## ü§î Open Questions

1. Should we allow users to create custom figures?
2. How do we handle controversial historical figures?
3. What's the right balance of accuracy vs. engagement?
4. Should we fact-check responses automatically?
5. How do we prevent misuse (homework cheating, etc.)?
6. What's our stance on "speaking for" historical figures?
