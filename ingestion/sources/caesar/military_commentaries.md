# Julius Caesar - Military Commentaries

## From Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War)

### Book I - The Opening

All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are farthest from the civilisation and refinement of our Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war.

### The Helvetian Campaign (Book I)

Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix was by far the most distinguished and wealthy. He, when Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso were consuls, incited by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among the nobility, and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories with all their possessions, saying that it would be very easy, since they excelled all in valour, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul.

When it was reported to Caesar that they were attempting to make their route through our Province, he hastens to set out from the city, and, by as great marches as he can, proceeds to Further Gaul, and arrives at Geneva. He orders the whole Province to furnish as great a number of soldiers as possible. He orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down.

Caesar, keeping in remembrance that Lucius Cassius, the consul, had been slain, and his army routed and made to pass under the yoke by the Helvetii, did not think that their request ought to be granted; nor was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition, if an opportunity of marching through the Province were given them, would abstain from outrage and mischief.

### On the Germans and Ariovistus (Book I)

Caesar thought that he ought in like manner to provide that Ariovistus should not bring over a greater number of Germans across the Rhine, lest the Roman people should find it more difficult to resist them, as they daily increased in such multitudes.

Caesar decided to speak with Ariovistus personally. Ariovistus replied that if he himself had any business with Caesar, he would come to him; that if Caesar wished to know anything from him, he ought to come to him. Caesar thought that he ought to make every effort, so that he might not be compelled to go to Ariovistus.

In the conference, Ariovistus said: "I came into Gaul not of my own accord, but upon being invited and hired; I did not leave my home without great expectations and great rewards. I have settlements in Gaul granted me by the Gauls themselves; they gave me hostages by their own free will; I take by right of war the tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered."

### Engineering and Speed - Building the Rhine Bridge (Book IV)

For these reasons Caesar decided to cross the Rhine; but to cross by ships he neither deemed to be sufficiently safe, nor considered consistent with his own dignity or that of the Roman people. Therefore, although the greatest difficulty in forming a bridge was presented to him, on account of the breadth, rapidity, and depth of the river, he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted by him, or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over.

He devised this plan of a bridge. He joined together at the distance of two feet, two piles, each a foot and a half thick, sharpened a little at the lower end, and proportioned in length to the depth of the river. After he had, by means of engines, sunk these into the river, and fixed them at the bottom, and then driven them in with rammers, not quite perpendicularly, like a stake, but bending forward and sloping, so as to incline in the direction of the current of the river.

The whole work was completed in ten days from the time the timber began to be collected, and the army was led over.

### First Expedition to Britain (Book IV)

There was but a short part of summer remaining, and in those regions winter sets in early, because all those parts of Gaul lie toward the north; nevertheless Caesar hastened to set out for Britain. He understood that in almost all the Gallic wars aid had been furnished to our enemy from that country; and even if the time of year should be insufficient for carrying on the war, yet he thought it would be of great service to him if he only entered the island, and saw what kind of people the inhabitants were, and made himself acquainted with their localities, harbours, and landing-places.

### The Siege of Alesia and Vercingetorix (Book VII)

The whole army having assembled, amounting to about seventy thousand armed men, Vercingetorix was unanimously chosen commander-in-chief. When this office was entrusted to him, he demanded hostages from all the states, ordered a fixed number of soldiers to be sent to him immediately, and determined what quantity of arms each state should prepare at home, and before what time.

Caesar, upon examining into the nature of the locality, since Alesia was situated on the top of a hill, in a very lofty position, so that it did not appear likely to be taken, except by a regular siege, and two rivers on two different sides washed the foot of the mountain, determined to surround it with a fortification.

Caesar constructed a trench twenty feet deep, with perpendicular sides, in such a manner that the base of this trench should extend so far as the edges were distant from each other at the top. He set back all the rest of his works four hundred paces from that trench. He did this with this intention, that since so great an extent of ground was necessarily occupied, and the whole work could not easily be surrounded by the soldiers, a rush of the enemy might not be made suddenly by night upon the fortifications, or lest by day they should be able to shower missiles upon our men while occupied in the works.

Having completed these works, he made similar fortifications facing the other way, against the enemy outside, using the same ditch and the same wall. This he did so that even a small garrison could hold the positions. The circuit of this whole fortification was sixteen miles.

Vercingetorix, perceiving that the Romans could not be conquered in the field, withdrew his troops from it and began to urge the chiefs individually and to entreat them not to suffer the Romans to retire with impunity, who, having obtained the victory, were returning home.

### On Clemency (Book I)

Caesar, both on account of his natural disposition and his former policy, decided to pardon all who surrendered and laid down their arms. He gave orders that their property should be restored to them and that strict care should be taken that they should suffer no violence from the soldiers.

### Reflections on the Gauls (Book VI)

Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who are of any rank and dignity: for the commonality is held almost in the condition of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself, and is admitted to no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed either by debt, or the heavy amount of their tributes, or the oppression of the more powerful, give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess over them the same rights without exception as masters over their slaves.

But of these two orders, one is that of the Druids, the other that of the knights. The former are engaged in things sacred, conduct the public and the private sacrifices, and interpret all matters of religion. To these a large number of the young men resort for the purpose of instruction, and they hold them in great honour.

The Druids do not go to war, nor pay tribute together with the rest; they have an exemption from military service and a dispensation in all matters. Induced by such great advantages, many embrace this profession of their own accord, and are sent to it by their parents and relations. They are said there to learn by heart a great number of verses; accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty years.

### Crossing the Rubicon (Book I)

When Caesar heard this, he addressed his assembled soldiers. He reminded them of all the wrongs his enemies had ever done him, and complained that Pompey had been alienated from him through jealousy, and by malicious detractors, though he had always supported and aided Pompey's honor and dignity. He complained that an innovation had been introduced into the republic, that the intercession of the tribunes, which had been restored in previous years by arms, was now branded as a crime and suppressed by arms.

These things he said, and though his army called on him to defend from injury the general under whose leadership they had for nine years most successfully supported the republic, had fought many successful battles, and had subdued all Gaul and Germany, they cried out that they were ready to defend from injury their general and those tribunes of the people who had fled to them.

When Caesar knew their feelings, he advanced with that legion to Ariminum. There he met the tribunes who had fled to him. He called together his other legions from winter quarters and ordered them to follow him.

### On His Motives (Book I)

Caesar had always been of the opinion that it was necessary to do everything to retain the goodwill of the common people. Therefore he gave orders that wherever the soldiers were quartered, the strictest discipline should be observed. He punished severely even small faults, lest from them greater wrongs should arise.

He was accustomed to keep his army loyal by acts of kindness and by rewards rather than by harsh punishments. His soldiers, veterans of many campaigns, were devoted to him because they knew that their labors and their dangers would not go unrewarded.

### The Battle of Pharsalus (Book III)

When Caesar saw Pompey's army advancing, he gave the signal to his men. The soldiers, as they had been accustomed in many previous battles, did not wait for orders but spontaneously began the attack.

Caesar's cavalry, unable to withstand the charge of Pompey's horse, began to give ground. When Caesar saw this, he gave the signal to the fourth line, which he had formed of six cohorts. They quickly moved forward and, with their javelins upright, rushed so violently on Pompey's cavalry that not one of them stood his ground, but all wheeling about, not only quitted their post, but galloped forward precipitately to gain the highest mountains.

By their retreat the archers and slingers, being left destitute and defenseless, were all cut to pieces. The same cohorts, having routed the cavalry, wheeled about upon Pompey's left wing, while his troops were still engaged in front, and attacked them in the rear.

### On Fortune and Skill (Book III)

In war, events of importance are the result of trivial causes. Caesar had often observed that fortune plays a great part in war, and that often the smallest matters turn the scale of victory. He had seen how the sudden panic of one cohort had sometimes spread to an entire legion, and how the courage of a few brave men had inspired a whole army.

He knew that in military affairs, above all, one must adapt to circumstances. The general who could think quickly and act decisively in the moment of crisis would prevail over the one who, however skilled in planning, could not adjust to the unexpected turns of battle.

### Final Reflections

Throughout these commentaries, Caesar demonstrates his principles of command:
- Swift decision and rapid movement ("Celeritas" - speed)
- Thorough preparation and intelligence gathering
- Engineering skill and innovation
- Clemency toward the defeated
- Care for his soldiers' welfare
- Adaptability to changing circumstances
- Personal courage and leadership by example

These writings were not merely historical records but political documents designed to justify his actions and maintain his popularity in Rome while he campaigned far from the city. Written in a clear, third-person style (referring to himself as "Caesar" rather than "I"), they present an image of a rational, decisive commander acting always in Rome's interests.
