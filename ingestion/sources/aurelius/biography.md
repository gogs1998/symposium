# Marcus Aurelius - Biography

## Early Life

Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was born on April 26, 121 CE, in Rome to a prominent family with close ties to the imperial court. Born Marcus Annius Verus, he was the son of Annius Verus and Domitia Lucilla. His father died when Marcus was young, and he was raised by his grandfather, also named Marcus Annius Verus, who had served as consul three times.

From an early age, Marcus displayed exceptional intellectual abilities and attracted the attention of Emperor Hadrian, who nicknamed him "Verissimus" (most truthful). When Hadrian died in 138 CE, his successor Antoninus Pius adopted Marcus as part of the succession plan, along with Lucius Verus. Marcus received an exemplary education in rhetoric, philosophy, Greek, and Latin, studying under distinguished teachers including the Stoic philosopher Epictetus's student Junius Rusticus, who introduced him to Stoic philosophy.

Marcus married Faustina the Younger, daughter of Antoninus Pius, in 145 CE. They had at least fourteen children, though only six survived to adulthood. His son Commodus would later succeed him as emperor, though proving to be a stark contrast to his father's philosophical temperament.

## Major Achievements

Marcus Aurelius became co-emperor with Lucius Verus in 161 CE, the first time Rome had two emperors ruling simultaneously. After Verus's death in 169 CE, Marcus ruled alone until his death in 180 CE. His reign is remembered as the last of the "Five Good Emperors" and represents the end of the Pax Romana, the long period of relative peace and prosperity.

Despite his philosophical inclinations toward peace and contemplation, Marcus spent much of his reign defending the empire's borders. He successfully campaigned against the Parthian Empire in the east and fought the lengthy Marcomannic Wars (166-180 CE) against Germanic tribes along the Danube frontier. These campaigns, though militarily successful, drained the empire's resources.

Marcus demonstrated exceptional administrative ability, implementing legal reforms that protected slaves, widows, and minors. He promoted education, funding chairs of philosophy and rhetoric in major cities. During his reign, he faced significant challenges including plague (the Antonine Plague, possibly smallpox), which devastated the empire's population, and economic difficulties resulting from continuous warfare.

His greatest achievement, however, is his philosophical work "Meditations," written in Greek during military campaigns. This personal journal, never intended for publication, has become one of the most influential works in Western philosophy.

## Philosophy/Approach

Marcus Aurelius was a devoted practitioner of Stoicism, a philosophy emphasizing virtue, reason, and living in harmony with nature. His "Meditations" reveals a mind constantly examining itself, striving for self-improvement despite the burdens of imperial power.

Core tenets of his philosophy include:

**Acceptance of Fate**: Marcus embraced the Stoic concept of amor fati (love of fate), accepting events beyond his control with equanimity while focusing energy on what lies within his power—his judgments, desires, and actions.

**Impermanence and Death**: He frequently meditated on mortality and the transient nature of all things, not from morbidity but to maintain perspective and cherish the present moment.

**Universal Reason**: Marcus believed in a rational cosmos governed by divine reason (logos), of which human rationality is a part. This interconnectedness meant we have duties to fellow humans as members of a universal community.

**Virtue as the Sole Good**: External circumstances—wealth, fame, pleasure—are indifferent. Only virtue, particularly justice, courage, temperance, and wisdom, matters for a good life.

**Self-Discipline**: Constant vigilance over one's thoughts and reactions was essential, as our interpretations of events, not the events themselves, disturb us.

## Legacy

Marcus Aurelius stands as perhaps the finest example of Plato's philosopher-king—a ruler who embodied wisdom, justice, and philosophical reflection. His "Meditations" has never been out of print since its first publication and continues to resonate with readers seeking guidance on living meaningfully.

His influence extends beyond philosophy into popular culture, military leadership, and self-help literature. Statesmen, soldiers, and ordinary people have found solace and guidance in his reflections. His emphasis on personal responsibility, resilience in adversity, and maintaining moral integrity despite external pressures speaks to universal human challenges.

Paradoxically, his reign marks the beginning of Rome's decline. His decision to make his son Commodus emperor—breaking the adoptive succession that had produced effective rulers—had disastrous consequences. This highlights the tragedy of Marcus's life: despite his wisdom and virtue, he could not prevent the empire's eventual decline.

Modern Stoicism owes much of its revival to Marcus Aurelius, whose accessible, practical wisdom demonstrates philosophy's relevance to daily life rather than abstract speculation.

## Key Works

- **Meditations** (Ta eis heauton, "To Himself"): His only surviving work, divided into twelve books, containing personal reflections on Stoic philosophy, ethics, and practical wisdom. Written in Greek during military campaigns, primarily in the 170s CE, this private journal addresses themes of duty, mortality, rational living, and finding tranquility amid chaos. The work has been translated into numerous languages and remains one of the most widely read philosophical texts, offering timeless guidance on resilience, virtue, and meaning.

While "Meditations" is Marcus's only surviving complete work, ancient sources mention he studied and wrote extensively throughout his life, though these writings have been lost to history. His correspondence with his rhetoric teacher Fronto partially survives, revealing his education and intellectual development, though these letters are primarily of historical rather than philosophical interest.
