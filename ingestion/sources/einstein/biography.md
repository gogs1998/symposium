# Albert Einstein - Biography and Key Concepts

## Early Life and Education

Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire. His father Hermann Einstein was a salesman and engineer, and his mother was Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment.

Einstein attended elementary school at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. However, he felt alienated and struggled with the rigid pedagogical style. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning.

At the age of 12, Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. He began to grasp the concept of mathematical proof at age 12. He also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at that time.

## The Patent Office Years

After graduating from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900, Einstein faced difficulties securing an academic position. In 1902, he secured a job as an assistant examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. This position, while seemingly modest, gave Einstein time to pursue his own scientific inquiries.

It was during his time at the patent office that Einstein produced some of his most groundbreaking work. In 1905, often called his "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year), he published four papers that would revolutionize physics.

## Special Theory of Relativity

Einstein's special theory of relativity was published in his 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." The theory arose from his attempt to reconcile the laws of mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field.

The theory introduced two fundamental postulates:
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference
2. The speed of light in vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the light source

From these simple postulates, Einstein derived revolutionary conclusions:
- Time and space are not absolute but relative to the observer
- Mass and energy are equivalent (E=mc²)
- Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light

Einstein often used thought experiments to develop his ideas. One famous example: he imagined riding alongside a beam of light. If you could travel at the speed of light and look at a light beam moving beside you, what would you see? This thought experiment helped him realize that the speed of light must be constant for all observers.

## General Theory of Relativity

Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, extended special relativity to include gravity. He proposed that gravity is not a force but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

Einstein used another thought experiment to illustrate this: imagine standing in an elevator. If the elevator accelerates upward, you feel pressed to the floor, just as if gravity were pulling you down. Einstein realized there's no way to distinguish between gravitational attraction and acceleration - they're equivalent. This became known as the equivalence principle.

The theory predicted several phenomena:
- Light should bend in a gravitational field
- Time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields
- The orbit of Mercury should precess in a specific way

In 1919, Arthur Eddington's observation during a solar eclipse confirmed that light bends around the sun, exactly as Einstein predicted. This made Einstein world-famous overnight.

## Philosophy of Science

Einstein was deeply interested in the philosophy of science. He believed that "the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible." He felt that nature could be understood through mathematical laws, and he spent much of his life searching for a unified field theory that would combine gravity and electromagnetism.

He once said: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."

Einstein was skeptical of quantum mechanics, particularly its probabilistic interpretation. In his famous debate with Niels Bohr, he argued that "God does not play dice with the universe." He believed there must be hidden variables that would restore determinism to physics.

## Later Life and Legacy

Einstein moved to the United States in 1933, fleeing Nazi Germany. He accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his death in 1955.

Throughout his later years, he worked on attempting to develop a unified field theory but was unsuccessful. He also became an advocate for peace and civil rights, speaking out against racism and militarism.

Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey. His brain was preserved for scientific study, and his body was cremated. His legacy extends far beyond his scientific contributions - he became a symbol of genius and creative thinking.

## Key Quotes

"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."

"Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value."

"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."

"I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious."

"The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think."
